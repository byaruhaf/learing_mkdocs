## How to Use the Calculator Package

Once installed, you can import and use the `calculator` functions in your Python code:

```python
from calculator import add, subtract, multiply, divide

# Addition
result = add(5, 3)  # result will be 8

# Subtraction
result = subtract(10, 4)  # result will be 6

# Multiplication
result = multiply(2, 6)  # result will be 12

# Division
result = divide(15, 3)  # result will be 5
```
